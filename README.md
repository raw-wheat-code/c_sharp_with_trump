# Learn C# With Trump
*A satirical coding journey through the mind of the 45th President of the United States.*

## Overview

**Learn C# With Trump** is a parody project that teaches fundamental C# concepts —  
through the "logic" of Donald J. Trump.

Each code example and console app is inspired by real Trump quotes,  
modeled as "serious" C# programs that inevitably reveal broken reasoning, endless circular frustration, and authoritarian bravado — all wrapped in rich satire.

## Project Purpose

- **Teach** basic C# syntax, control flow, data structures, and logic.
- **Parody** political rhetoric, focusing on Trump's cause-and-effect worldview.
- **Demonstrate** how systems can seem "logical" on the surface but fall apart under structured thinking.
- **Have fun** writing absolutely absurd, but technically functional, programs.

## Current Modules

| Module | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **DeportationEvaluation** | Simulates Trump's plan to immediately deport criminals... but forever gets stuck in due process technicalities. |
| **TrumpExecutiveOrder** | Trump declares policies via hardcoded boolean switches and pretends to abolish inflation with a `true/false`. |
| **TrumpTaxAnalysis** *(planned)* | Analyze raising taxes on the rich — while blaming Ross Perot regardless of outcome. |
| **CriminalProfileEvaluator** *(planned)* | Randomly generates criminality scores based on stereotypes and random approval metrics. |

## Why Satirize Trump with C#?

Because Trump often speaks **in simple if/then statements** that sound like poorly written `switch` cases:

> "If gas prices go up, Joe Biden is a disaster. If gas prices go down, it's because I built the strongest economy in history."

Parodying his worldview as literal C# logic surfaces the **absurdity of oversimplified systems** —  
and teaches **real coding** in the process.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/learn-csharp-with-trump.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd learn-csharp-with-trump
    ```
3. Run the console app:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

**Requirements:**
- .NET 6.0 or higher
- A sense of humor

## Legal and Political Disclaimer

This project is **parody** and **satire** under fair use.  
It is **not** an endorsement or attack of any political figure.  
It exists **purely for educational and comedic purposes**, showcasing how rhetoric can be transformed into technical logic (and often break apart).

## License

MIT License — because if there's one thing Trump and open-source developers agree on,  
it's getting something for free.

## Future Plans

- More Trump quote-based console apps
- "Emergency Order" randomizers
- Fake "Supreme Court" that rules randomly on deportations
- Absurd unit tests that always fail due to "rigged judges"

## Closing Thoughts

> "Nobody builds better C# programs than me, believe me. They're beautiful. Absolutely beautiful."
